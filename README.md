**Introduction**

The game begins with the player, a special forces operative named Alex (or customizable character), being sent to the lab facility after communication with the scientists abruptly ceased. Upon arrival, Alex finds the place in chaosâ€”filled with aggressive, mutated vegetables that have overrun the laboratory. The vegetables are rapidly growing and evolving, and if they are not stopped, they pose a threat to the entire human race. They could soon spread beyond the lab.
As the player fights through various sections of the lab, collecting data and battling different types of angry vegetable monsters (from grotesque giant carrots to rampaging potato beasts), they begin to uncover clues about the truth behind the experiments.
